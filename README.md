# Abstract

This study analyzes the digital pricing model of Jinjiang Literature City, focusing on its multi-tier VIP pricing and demand mechanisms. Jinjiang adopts a differentiated pricing system based on chapter timeliness and user level, combining per-thousand-word pricing, membership discounts, and promotional events to stimulate paid reading. The platform also integrates virtual items and value-added services to enhance user engagement and monetization.

A mathematical pricing model and demand functions are developed under assumptions of rational and independent reader behavior. Results indicate that as user level increases, the marginal reading cost decreases, encouraging continuous consumption and loyalty. Jinjiang’s pricing model effectively balances user incentives, platform revenue, and long-term user retention, offering a reference for digital content platforms seeking sustainable monetization strategies.
